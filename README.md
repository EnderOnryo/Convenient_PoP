# Convenient PoP v1.0.0.0 (HK 1.5)
This mod makes it so when you hit a PoP Soul Totem or a Wingsmould with your Nail it fills your Soul to full.

Note: This currently doesn't work with Nail Arts.

Note 2: This version of the mod assumes Object IDs start with their vanilla IDs.

Wingsmould = White Palace Fly

PoP Soul Totem = Soul Totem white_Infinte
