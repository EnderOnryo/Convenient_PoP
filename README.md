# Convenient PoP v1.0.0.0 (HK 1.5)
This mod makes it so when you hit a PoP Soul Totem or a Wingsmould with your Nail it fills your Soul to full.

Note: This currently doesn't work with Nail Arts.

Thank you to SFGrenade for updating my garbage code and making this work with non vanilla Totrems and Wingsmoulds.
